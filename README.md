Hi,

I have some example C++ codes which I wrote while reading Larry Nyhoff's "[ADTs, Data Structures and Problem Solving with C++](http://www.amazon.com/ADTs-Structures-Problem-Solving-Edition/dp/0131409093/)". There are more little code laying around my harddisk but I'm sharing the ones which makes some sense. Please note that though I was familiar with OOP and C, I wrote these as a beginner in C++ and STL. So the code included may not be elegant or efficient.

This pack contains:

1. An inferior shortest path algorithm which does depth-first search by using a stack.
2. A 2D map class which holds maps you may come along in CS texbook problems or old 8-bit games. See one of the testmap files and you'll understand.
3. A binary tree container which was meant to be a BST implementation.
4. A directed graph with shortest path finding. It has its own [repo](https://github.com/aciliketcap/digraph). The code here may be out-dated, see the repo if you are interested.
